## Microsoft Lync Server on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start helps you build a Microsoft Lync Server 2013 environment in the AWS Cloud in a fault-tolerant and affordable way. Lync Server is a communications software platform that offers instant messaging (IM), conferencing, and telephony solutions for businesses of all sizes.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying Lync Server into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying Lync Server into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
